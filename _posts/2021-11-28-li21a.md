title: 'G-Net: a Recurrent Network Approach to G-Computation for Counterfactual Prediction
  Under a Dynamic Treatment Regime'
abstract: 'Counterfactual prediction is a fundamental task in decision-making. This
  paper introduces G-Net, a sequential deep learning framework for counterfactual  prediction
  under dynamic time-varying treatment strategies in complex longitudinal settings.
  G-Net is based upon g-computation, a causal inference method for estimating effects
  of general dynamic treatment strategies. Past g-computation implementations have
  mostly been built using classical regression models. G-Net instead adopts a recurrent
  neural network framework to capture complex temporal and nonlinear dependencies
  in the data. To our knowledge, G-Net is the first g-computation based deep sequential
  modeling framework that provides estimates of treatment effects under \em{dynamic}
  and \em{time-varying} treatment strategies. We evaluate G-Net using simulated longitudinal
  data from two sources: CVSim, a mechanistic model of the cardiovascular system,
  and a pharmacokinetic simulation of tumor growth. G-Net outperforms both classical
  and state-of-the-art counterfactual prediction models in these settings.'
