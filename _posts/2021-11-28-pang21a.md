title: 'CEHR-BERT: Incorporating temporal information from structured EHR data to
  improve prediction tasks'
abstract: 'Embedding algorithms are increasingly used to represent clinical concepts
  in healthcare for improving machine learning tasks such as clinical phenotyping
  and disease prediction. Recent studies have adapted state-of-the-art bidirectional
  encoder representations from transformers (BERT) architecture to structured electronic
  health records (EHR) data for the generation of contextualized concept embeddings,
  yet do not fully incorporate temporal data across multiple clinical domains. Therefore
  we developed a new BERT adaptation, CEHR-BERT, to incorporate temporal information
  using a hybrid approach by augmenting the input to BERT using artificial time tokens,
  incorporating time, age, and concept embeddings, and introducing a new second learning
  objective for visit type. CEHR-BERT was trained on a subset of  clinical data from
  Columbia University Irving Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital, which
  includes 2.4M patients, spanning over three decades, and tested using 4-fold evaluation
  on the following prediction tasks: hospitalization, death, new heart failure (HF)
  diagnosis, and HF readmission. Our experiments show that CEHR-BERT outperformed
  existing state-of-the-art clinical BERT adaptations and baseline models across all
  4 prediction tasks in both ROC-AUC and PR-AUC. CEHR-BERT also demonstrated strong
  few-shot learning capability, as our model trained on only 5% of data outperformed
  comparison models trained on the entire data set. Ablation studies to better understand
  the contribution of each time component showed incremental gains with every element,
  suggesting that CEHR-BERTâ€™s incorporation of artificial time tokens,  time/age embeddings
  with concept embeddings, and the addition of the second learning objective represents
  a promising approach for future BERT-based clinical embeddings.'
