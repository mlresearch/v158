title: Retrieval-Based Chest X-Ray Report Generation Using a Pre-trained Contrastive
  Language-Image Model
abstract: 'We propose CXR-RePaiR: a retrieval-based radiology report generation approach
  using a pre-trained contrastive language-image model. Our method generates clinically
  accurate reports on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. CXR-RePaiR
  outperforms or matches prior report generation methods on clinical metrics, achieving
  an average F$_1$ score of 0.352 ($\Delta$ + 7.98%) on an external radiology dataset
  (CheXpert). Further, we implement a compression approach used to reduce the size
  of the reference corpus and speed up the runtime of our retrieval method. With compression,
  our model maintains similar performance while producing reports 70% faster than
  the best generative model. Our approach can be broadly useful in improving the diagnostic
  performance and generalizability of report generation models and enabling their
  use in clinical workflows.'
