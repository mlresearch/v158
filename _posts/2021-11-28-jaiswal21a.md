title: 'RadBERT-CL: Factually-Aware Contrastive Learning For Radiology Report Classification'
abstract: Radiology reports are unstructured and contain the imaging findings and
  corresponding diagnoses transcribed by radiologists which include clinical facts
  and negated and/or uncertain statements. Extracting pathologic findings and diagnoses
  from radiology reports is important for quality control, population health, and
  monitoring of disease progress. Existing works, primarily rely either on rule-based
  systems or transformer-based pre-trained model fine-tuning, but could not take the
  factual and uncertain information into consideration, and therefore generate false
  positive outputs. In this work, we introduce three sedulous augmentation techniques
  which retain factual and critical information while generating augmentations for
  contrastive learning. We introduce RadBERT-CL, which fuses these information into
  BlueBert via a self-supervised contrastive loss. Our experiments on MIMIC-CXR show
  superior performance of RadBERT-CL on fine-tuning for multi-class, multi-label report
  classification. We illustrate that when few labeled data are available, RadBERT-CL
  outperforms conventional SOTA transformers (BERT/BlueBert) by significantly larger
  margins (6-11%). We also show that the representations learned by RadBERT-CL can
  capture critical medical information in the latent space.
