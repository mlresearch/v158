title: End-to-End Sequential Sampling and Reconstruction for MRI
abstract: 'Accelerated MRI shortens acquisition time by subsampling in the measurement
  $\kappa$-space. Recovering a high-fidelity anatomical image from subsampled measurements
  requires close cooperation between two components: (1) a sampler that chooses the
  subsampling pattern and (2) a reconstructor that recovers images from incomplete
  measurements. In this paper, we leverage the sequential nature of MRI measurements,
  and propose a fully differentiable framework that jointly learns a sequential sampling
  policy simultaneously with a reconstruction strategy. This co-designed framework
  is able to adapt during acquisition in order to capture the most informative measurements
  for a particular target. Experimental results on the fastMRI knee dataset demonstrate
  that the proposed approach successfully utilizes intermediate information during
  the sampling process to boost reconstruction performance. In particular, our proposed
  method can outperform the current state-of-the-art learned $\kappa$-space sampling
  baseline on over 96% of test samples. We also investigate the individual and collective
  benefits of the sequential sampling and co-design strategies.'
