title: Image Classification with Consistent Supporting Evidence
abstract: Adoption of machine learning models in healthcare requires end usersâ€™ trust
  in the system. Models that provide additional supportive evidence for their predictions
  promise to facilitate adoption. We define consistent evidence to be both compatible
  and sufficient with respect to model predictions. We propose measures of model inconsistency
  and regularizers that promote more consistent evidence. We demonstrate our ideas
  in the context of edema severity grading from chest radiographs. We demonstrate
  empirically that consistent models provide competitive performance while supporting
  interpretation.
