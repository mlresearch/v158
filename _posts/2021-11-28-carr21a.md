title: Longitudinal patient stratification of electronic health records with flexible
  adjustment for clinical outcomes
abstract: The increase in availability of longitudinal EHR data is leading to improved
  understanding of diseases and discovery of novel phenotypes. The majority of clustering
  algorithms focus only on patient trajectories, yet patients with similar trajectories
  may have different outcomes. Finding subgroups of patients with different trajectories
  and outcomes can guide future drug development and improve recruitment to clinical
  trials. We develop a recurrent neural network autoencoder to cluster EHR data using
  reconstruction, outcome, and clustering losses which can be weighted to find different
  types of patient clusters. We show our model is able to discover known clusters
  from both data biases and outcome differences, outperforming baseline models. We
  demonstrate the model performance on 29,229 diabetes patients, showing it finds
  clusters of patients with both different trajectories and different outcomes which
  can be utilized to aid clinical decision making.
